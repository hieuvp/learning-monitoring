## Prometheus and Its Ecosystem

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)
  is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit.
  It joined the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (`CNCF`)
  in 2016 as the second hosted project, after Kubernetes.

- [Grafana](https://grafana.com)
  is a tool that can combine data from many places into a single dashboard.
  It allows you to query, visualize and alert on metrics and logs no matter where they are stored.
